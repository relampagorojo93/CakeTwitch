#---{Prizes}
#
# Specify the drops per channel. To define prizes per channel, define the name of
# the section with the name of the channel. Use the 'Default' section to define
# default prizes for all the channels. Chance is treated as tickets, meaning that
# the ticket while dropping is the prize which, after adding its previous prizes chances,
# result is higher than the ticket.
# Ex:
#   Prize1 - 50
#   Prize2 - 5
#   Prize3 - 1
#
# If the ticket is 54, can't be the first prize as its higher. After adding the previous
# prizes to the second one, the result is 55, a higher number than the ticket, ending up
# as the chosen prize.
#
# Use [] to define an empty list of commands.
